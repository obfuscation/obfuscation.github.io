{"name":"Pluggable Transports","tagline":"Obfuscation collaboration web presence","body":"Introduction\r\n====\r\n\r\nThis repository is a cross-project collaboration space for censorship circumvention tools.\r\nOur initial focus is expanding Tor's [pluggable transports](https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/blob/HEAD:/pt-spec.txt) work to easily\r\nwork in a wider variety of circumvention tools. Initial collaborators include [Lantern](http://getlantern.org),\r\n[Psiphon](https://s3.amazonaws.com/0ubz-2q11-gi9y/en.html), [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/) and \r\n[uProxy](https://www.google.com/ideas/projects/uproxy/).\r\n\r\nCollaboration\r\n====\r\n\r\nThere are two main collaboration spaces:\r\n\r\n**Mailing List**: [Our Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!forum/traffic-obf)\r\n\r\n**IRC Meeting**: The Pluggable Transports community conducts biweekly IRC meetings. You can \r\nfind us in #tor-dev at the OFTC network [every second friday](https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=dt92shou5q1ooe1kptubhclo4s%40group.calendar.google.com) at \r\n[16:00 UTC](http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?hour=16&min=00&sec=0p1=0).\r\n\r\nGoals\r\n====\r\n\r\nWe hope to get to refactor Tor's Pluggable Transport specification in to a core specification that\r\ncan be used by a variety of circumvention tools. Each tool can then write up their own project-specific\r\nspecification for how to make a pluggable transport work with its internal infrastructure.\r\n\r\nWhat is a Pluggable Transport?\r\n====\r\n\r\nPluggable Transports were defined by Tor, but some (FTEProxy, Meek) have already been adapted to \r\nother tools (Lantern, Psiphon. They are:\r\n\r\n* Standalone processes that accept traffic from a client and route it to a server\r\n\r\n* Require client and server-side processes that know how to talk to each other\r\n\r\n* Are aimed at obfuscating traffic so that censors can't tell it's coming from a circumvention tool. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe obfuscation is the hard part, and as long as it's built using fairly generic interfaces (the way that fteproxy is), it can be reused quite easily across projects, even though their mechanisms for managing and communicating with pluggable transports are different.\r\n\r\nPluggable Transport Integrations\r\n====\r\n\r\n| Transports                                           | Support in\r\n-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|\r\n| [obfs2](https://gitweb.torproject.org/pluggable-transports/obfsproxy.git/blob/HEAD:/doc/obfs2/obfs2-protocol-spec.txt)         | [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/)                                                        |\r\n| [obfs3](https://gitweb.torproject.org/pluggable-transports/obfsproxy.git/blob/HEAD:/doc/obfs3/obfs3-protocol-spec.txt)         | [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/), [Lantern](http://getlantern.org)                      |\r\n| [FTE](https://fteproxy.org/)                                                                                                   | [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/)                                                        |\r\n| [scramblesuit](http://www.cs.kau.se/philwint/scramblesuit/)                                                                    | [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/)                                                        |\r\n| [obfuscatedssh](https://github.com/brl/obfuscated-openssh/blob/master/README.obfuscation)                                      | [Psiphon](https://psiphon.ca/)                                                            |\r\n| [meek](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/meek)                                                                 | [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/),  [Psiphon](https://psiphon.ca/)                       |\r\n| [flashproxy](https://crypto.stanford.edu/flashproxy/)                                                                          | [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/)                                                        |\r\n| [socks-rtc](https://github.com/uProxy/socks-rtc)                                                                               | [uProxy](https://www.google.com/ideas/projects/uproxy/)                                   |\r\n| [flashlight](https://github.com/getlantern/flashlight)                                                                         | [Lantern](https://www.getlantern.org/)                                                    |\r\n\r\n\r\nTor's PT links:\r\n=====\r\n\r\n[pt-spec.txt](https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/blob/HEAD:/pt-spec.txt)\r\n\r\n[Extended ORPort](https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/blob/HEAD:/proposals/196-transport-control-ports.txt)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Extended ORPort authentication](https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/blob/HEAD:/proposals/217-ext-orport-auth.txt)\r\n\r\nAlso:\r\nhttps://www.torproject.org/docs/pluggable-transports\r\nhttps://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/PluggableTransports\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
